 RTK Query (Best for rapid development)
RTK Query is Redux Toolkit‚Äôs built-in powerful data-fetching tool. please 


ChatGPT said:
Awesome! RTK Query is a game-changer when it comes to API integration with Redux Toolkit ‚Äî it gives you automatic caching, re-fetching, loading states, error handling, and even auto-generated hooks.

Let me walk you through how to set it up step by step.

import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react';
‚úÖ You're importing:

createApi: the core function to define an API slice.

fetchBaseQuery: a small wrapper around fetch() ‚Äî acts like Axios, handles GET, POST, etc. You can customize it or replace it with Axios if needed.



export const apiSlice = createApi({
‚úÖ You're creating and exporting an API slice named apiSlice. This is similar to createSlice in Redux Toolkit, but for API logic (queries, mutations, caching, etc.).

reducerPath: 'api',
‚úÖ This sets the key in the Redux store where RTK Query will store its state (loading, error, data, cache, etc.).


aseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/' }),
‚úÖ This is the base configuration for all API requests. You're saying:

Every endpoint will start with this base URL.

So when you write query: () => 'users', the real URL becomes:


endpoints: (builder) => ({ })

    builder in endpoints: (builder) => ({ ... })
‚úÖ What is builder?
In RTK Query, builder is a helper object provided inside the endpoints function. It gives you methods like:

builder.query() ‚Üí for GET requests

builder.mutation() ‚Üí for POST, PUT, DELETE (i.e., write operations)

Think of builder as a toolbox to help you define what kind of endpoint you‚Äôre creating.


You‚Äôre defining a mutation named login.

This tells RTK Query: ‚ÄúThis is a POST request that may change server data.‚Äù

RTK Query then generates the hook:


STORE:

[authApi.reducerPath]: authApi.reducer, key is in [] square brackets? due to computed value name or anything else and why .reducerpath is added  


What is "middleware" in Redux?
In Redux, middleware sits between your dispatch calls and the reducers. It allows you to:

Intercept actions

Perform async logic (like API calls)

Log actions

Handle caching, retries, etc.

What does getDefaultMiddleware() do?
getDefaultMiddleware() is a function from Redux Toolkit that gives you all the default middleware pre-configured for safety and convenience, like:

redux-thunk for async logic

serializableCheck to ensure state/actions are serializable

immutableCheck to warn against state mutation

Why do we call .concat(authApi.middleware, userApi.middleware)?
This is where we add RTK Query‚Äôs custom middleware to the middleware chain.

RTK Query middleware handles:
API request/response lifecycle

Caching & re-fetching

Background updates

Error handling

DevTools integration

If you don‚Äôt add it, RTK Query won‚Äôt work properly.


LOGIN: 

const [login, { isLoading, isError, error }] = useLoginMutation(); // RTK Query hook

      const response = await login(login_payloadData).unwrap(); // unwrap gets plain response

üîπ .unwrap()
RTK Query's .unwrap() is a helper that:

Extracts the plain response data (removes the wrapper)

Throws an error automatically if the request fails
(so you can use try/catch like with regular fetch/axios)


Without .unwrap()
If you just write:

const response = await login(login_payloadData);
console.log(response);
You get an object like:

{
  data: { token: "abc123", isSuccess: true },
  meta: {...},
  error: undefined
}



With .unwrap()
This:


const response = await login(login_payloadData).unwrap();
Gives you:


{ token: "abc123", isSuccess: true }
